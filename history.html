<h1>History of HTML, CSS, and Javascript</h1>

<br>
<h2>History of HTML</h2>

<br>
<p class="indent">
&emsp;&emsp;HTML was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991
but was not released officially, which was published
in 1995 as HTML 2.0. HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999 and
was a major version of HTML. HTML is a very evolving markup
language and has evolved with various versions updating.
Long before its revised standards and specifications are
carried in, each version has allowed its user to create web pages in the much easier
 and prettier way and make sites very efficient.</p>
<ul class="indent">
<li>HTML 1.0 was released in 1993 with the intention of sharing information which can be readable and accessible via web browsers. But not much of the developers were involved in creating websites. So the language was also not growing.</li>
<br>
<li>Then comes the HTML 2.0, published in 1995; which contains all the features of HTML 1.0 along with that few additional features; which remained as the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until January 1997 and refined various core features of HTML.</li>
<br>
<li>Then comes the HTML 3.0, where Dave Raggett who introduced a fresh paper or draft on HTML. It included improved new features of HTML, giving more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing web pages. But these powerful features of new HTML slowed down the browser in applying further improvements.</li>
<br>
<li>Then comes the HTML 4.01 which is widely used and was a successful version of HTML before HTML 5.0, which is currently released and used worldwide. HTML 5 can be said for as an extended version of HTML 4.01 which was published in the year 2012.</li>

<h2>History of CSS</h2>
<br>
<h3>CSS 1</h3>
<p class="indent">&emsp;&emsp;The first CSS specification to become an official W3C Recommendation is CSS level 1,
   published on December 17, 1996. Håkon Wium Lie and Bert Bos are credited as the original developers.
    Among its capabilities are support for:</p>
<ol class="indent">
  <li>Font properties such as typeface and emphasis</li><br>
  <li>Color of text, backgrounds, and other elements</li><br>
  <li>Text attributes such as spacing between words, letters, and lines of text</li><br>
  <li>Alignment of text, images, tables and other elements</li><br>
  <li>Margin, border, padding, and positioning for most elements</li><br>
  <li>Unique identification and generic classification of groups of attributes</li><br>
</ol>
<center><p>The W3C no longer maintains the CSS 1 Recommendation.</p></center>
<br>
<br>
<h3>CSS 2</h3>
<p class="indent">&emsp;&emsp;CSS level 2 specification was developed by the W3C and published as a recommendation
in May 1998. A superset of CSS 1, CSS 2 includes a number of new capabilities like
absolute, relative, and fixed positioning of elements and z-index, the concept of
media types, support for aural style sheets (which were later replaced by the CSS
3 speech modules) and bidirectional text, and new font properties such as shadows.</p>
<center><p>The W3C no longer maintains the CSS 2 recommendation.</p></center>
<br>
<br>
<h3>CSS 2.1</h3>
<p class="indent">&emsp;&emsp;CSS level 2 revision 1, often referred to as "CSS 2.1", fixes errors in CSS 2, removes poorly supported or not fully interoperable features and adds already implemented browser extensions to the specification. To comply with the W3C Process for standardizing technical specifications, CSS 2.1 went back and forth between Working Draft status and Candidate Recommendation status for many years. CSS 2.1 first became a Candidate Recommendation on February 25, 2004, but it was reverted to a Working Draft on June 13, 2005 for further review. It returned to Candidate
Recommendation on 19 July 2007 and then updated twice in 2009. However,
because changes and clarifications were made, it again went back to Last
Call Working Draft on 7 December 2010.</p>
<center><p>CSS 2.1 went to Proposed Recommendation on 12 April 2011. After being
reviewed by the W3C Advisory Committee, it was finally published as a W3C
Recommendation on 7 June 2011.</p></center>
<center><p>CSS 2.1 was planned as the first and final revision of level 2—but low
priority work on CSS 2.2 began in 2015.</p></center>
<br>
<br>
<h3>CSS 3</h3>
<p class="indent">&emsp;&emsp;Unlike CSS 2, which is a large single specification defining various
features, CSS 3 is divided into several separate documents called "modules".
Each module adds new capabilities or extends features defined in CSS 2, preserving
backward compatibility. Work on CSS level 3 started around the time of publication
of the original CSS 2 recommendation. The earliest CSS 3 drafts were published in
June 1999.</p>
<center><p>Due to the modularization, different modules have different stability and statuses.</p></center>
<center><p>Some modules have Candidate Recommendation (CR) status and are considered moderately stable. At CR stage, implementations are advised to drop vendor prefixes.</p></center>
<br>
<br>
<h3>CSS 4</h3>
<center><p>There is no single, integrated CSS4 specification, because it is split into separate "level 4" modules.</p></center>
<p class="indent">&emsp;&emsp;Because CSS3 split the CSS language's definition into modules,
the modules have been allowed to level independently. Most modules are level
3—they build on things from CSS 2.1. A few level-4 modules exist (such as
Image Values, Backgrounds & Borders, or Selectors), which build on the
functionality of a preceding level-3 module. Other modules defining entirely
new functionality, such as Flexbox, have been designated as "level 1".</p>

<p class="indent">&emsp;&emsp;The CSS Working Group sometimes publishes "Snapshots",
a collection of whole modules and parts of other drafts that are considered stable,
interoperably implemented and hence ready to use. So far, five such "best current
practices" documents have been published as Notes, in 2007, 2010, 2015, 2017, and 2018.</p>

<h2>History of Javascript</h2>
  <h3>JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 during his time at Netscape
    Communications. It was inspired by Java, Scheme and Self.</h3>

<p class="indent">&emsp;&emsp;Netscape, for a time, made the best browser in the world and enjoyed market
  dominance.</p>
<p class="indent">&emsp;&emsp;In late 1995, when Microsoft cottoned-on to the competitive threat the Web
  posed, the Internet Explorer project was started in an all-out attempt to
  wrestle control of the emerging platform from Netscape.</p>
<p class="indent">&emsp;&emsp;In so doing Microsoft became a mortal threat, compelling Netscape to respond.
  First, they started a standardization process to prevent Microsoft gaining
  control of the JavaScript language. Second, they partnered with Sun to
  leverage their shared interest in breaking the Microsoft monopoly.</p>
<p class="indent">&emsp;&emsp;Sun began development of Java in 1990 in an attempt to write a language for
  “smart appliances”. This approach floundered and in 1994, Sun regrouped and
  set sights on the Web as the delivery platform of choice.</p>
<p class="indent">&emsp;&emsp;So the Netscape/Sun partnership meant Sun acquired the use of a competitive
  browser and a delivery system for their strategic technology.
  Netscape, on the other hand found a powerful ally against Microsoft. They
  also aimed to out-manoeuvre Microsoft by being the official browser of the
  highly anticipated platform that was Java.</p>
<p class="indent">&emsp;&emsp;Brendan Eich has said that with Sun on board, they decided to surf the tidal
  wave of hype surrounding Java and position JavaScript as the companion
  language to Java, in the same way Visual Basic was to C++. So the name was
  a straightforward marketing ploy to gain acceptance.</p>
<p class="indent">&emsp;&emsp;Netscape’s Mocha (later JavaScript) aimed to turn the web into a full-blown
  application platform. Furthermore, when used together with their LiveWire
  application server product, it would enable isomorphic development, with
  the same language used on both client and server.</p>
<p class="indent">&emsp;&emsp;If this sounds familiar, it is because this was exactly what Sun was
  attempting to pull off with Java. At the time however, the Web was very
  limited when compared to Java; for example, drawing pixels was not possible
  in JavaScript as it is now with canvas. So Sun (erroneously, I believe) never
  saw the language as a competitor and the alliance held.</p>
<p class="indent">&emsp;&emsp;Unfortunately for JavaScript, its early market positioning outlived its
  usefulness and later became a brake on market acceptance as it emerged as a
  viable technology in its own right.</p>
<p class="indent">&emsp;&emsp;So JavaScript was conceived as a scripting language for the Web for both
  client and server side. It was then quickly re-positioned as a Web
  “companion” for Java.</p>
<p class="indent">&emsp;&emsp;The unique circumstances of the birth of the language, including:</p>
  <ul class="indent">
  <li>the aforementioned marketing ploy,</li>
  <br>
  <li>time-compressed initial development,</li>
  <br>
  <li>a prejudice that development for the Web was not “serious”,</li>
  <br>
  <li>the ubiquitous and “unbreakable” deployment environment (the Web), and</li>
  <br>
  <li>the inclusion of language design elements unfamiliar to most developers</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
<p class="indent">&emsp;&emsp;…led to a years-long period of misunderstanding, scorn and, yes,
  even hatred for the language. In the late 1990s and early 2000s even the
  authors of some books on JavaScript didn’t understand the fundamental elements
  of the language.</p>
<p class="indent">&emsp;&emsp;Douglas Crockford was one of the pioneers of the rediscovery of the language.
  And the importance of his invention of the JSON data format using a subset of
  JavaScript syntax should not be underestimated. During the 2000s mindshare
  slowly shifted to view JavaScript as a serious language: a critical mass of
  developers emerged who understood the language.</p>
<p class="indent">&emsp;&emsp;However, the “outsider status” of JavaScript continues to reverberate. Early
  design choices like automatic semicolon insertion (ASI), the event loop,
  lack of classes, unusual inheritance (prototypical) and type coercion are
  laughed at by people who have not taken the time to understand the thinking
  behind them.</p>
<p class="indent">&emsp;&emsp;Developers watch other developers laughing at these features and
  infer that these features are worthy of ridicule and the cycle continues.</p>
<p class="indent">&emsp;&emsp;Even Brendan Eich, the creator of the language, is occasionally
  apologetic for design decisions he made for the language.</p>
<p class="indent">&emsp;&emsp;However, in my view these expressions of apology should not be
  taken as confirmation that those decisions were wrong: but rather
  acknowledgement of the necessary inability of one language to please all
  developers.</p>
<p class="indent">&emsp;&emsp;As we will see in later posts, criticisms of JavaScript are frequently
  insubstantial expressions of unfamiliarity or syntactic “taste”, by
  programmers more familiar with other languages.</p>
<p class="indent">&emsp;&emsp;This is not to say the language is without flaws: the continuing
  lack of a decimal number primitive is unfortunate.</p>
