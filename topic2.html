<h2>3. Michael Hill</h2>
<p class="indent">Michael is a current student at West, and will graduate in the spring of 2020.
He has made SEIBA multiple times and even made All-State in the Fall of 2019.
Michael is a very good percussionist and still has plenty of time to learn and
get even better. He is someone to look up to, despite being short.</p>

<br>
<h2>2. Chane Eckhardt</h2>
<p class="indent">Chane Eckhardt was a naturally skilled percussionist. He was able to not
practice until a week before All-State and make it with his magnificent skill.
He graduated from West in the spring of 2018 with the title of 2 times All-Stater.
Despite being generally cocky, Chane definitely had the skill to back up his talk.
Possibly one of the best Percussionists that ever went to West. His current
whereabouts are unknown.</p>

<h2>1. Carson Kahley</h2>
<p class="indent">Even though Carson may not have been as naturally talented as Chane,
He is still remembered in our hearts more than anyone that stepped foot on
the West High Drumline. It was a role model and a leader, and a friend to
everyone. There were entire sections of the bible set out for this legend.
There will always be fond memories including this man, including the noteworthy
kiss that Carson and Gabe Gaghagen have exchanged on three different events.
I was lucky to attend one of them. Overall, no one will ever match the greatness
that Carson Kahley brought to West High School.</p>
